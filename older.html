                  <p>Dear Future Self,
                     <br>
                     First year university - it's great! I'm slowly figuring out what I want to be doing in 5 years. What are you doing?
                     I am leaning towards going into sustainabilty and the environment. Dad always told me I would be a superhero and save
                     the world one day, so maybe this is it? I hope you're happy, and content with life. I hope you got over your fear
                     of heights. I hope you travelled to South America! I hope you're not me anymore, but I hope I'm you.
                  </p>

                  <p>Dear Future Self, <br>
                     They keep telling me that I need to go to uni. But I don't want to do that. I'm scared that it will mean that
                     I will get stuck in a degree I don't want to be doing, then I'll have a job I don't want to be doing, and that will be
                     the end, you know? I want to get a car and drive away from everything, and escape for a little while. Find myself? You know,
                     I think I'm too scared to do even that...I hope you're braver than I am...

                     I just had a particularly scarring night involving karaoke and lots of tequila. Please please please be better
                     at making life decisions than me.

                  <p>Dear Future Self,
                     <br>
                     I imagine a sea change, or a forest change, or a hills change - definitely a change of some sort.
                     Are you still going out with J? I kind of hope not. Maybe if you break up, that's when you'll make that change.
                     I just want that little house out near the sea, or forest, or in the hills, etc. - something that is
                     not this stupid busy hectic city life, where all I do is work and see J.

                     Don't run away like you always do. I just walked away from something amazing and I regret it immensely.
                     I hope you have learned your lesson.
