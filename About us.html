                  <h3>All women deserve to have a voice - read their stories here</h3>
                  <p class="lead">In 2017, the #Metoo Movement went viral on social media as thousands of women shared their stories and experiences of sexual harrassment and assault, exposing the prevalence of sexual violence in the society.
                     More and more women joined the movement on social media and beyond.
                     The movement did more than raise awareness of the continued existence of sexism in the everday female* experience: it created a sense of solidarity and empowered women, encouraging them to speak up for themselves - or against their oppressors.
                  </p>
                  <p class="lead">#Youtoo has been created in response: here women have the chance to share their stories. Here, women are invited to write to write letters to themselves, younger or older.</p>
                  <p class="lead">Read these letters and find advice and inspiration in their stories. When you're ready, you can write one too.</p>

                     <h3>The Letters</h3>
                     <p class="lead">Women are invited to submit their letters to our website, with accompanying images or other media.
                        These submissions will be shared on the website for others to read, respond and share.
                     </p>
                     <p class="lead">Women can write either a Letter to their younger self - giving them advice, telling them to stay strong, reminding them that it will all be OK -
                        or a Letter to their older self about their hopes and dreams.
                        Whatever you choose - tell your story the way you want to.
