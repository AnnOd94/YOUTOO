  <p>Dear ______ </p>
  <br/>
  <p>You're looking at your daughter for the first time and whispering in her ear: "I am going to look after you, and you are going to do amazing things in life".
    You never expected to have a baby at 20, but once you realised you were pregnant, you knew you'd never love anyone more.
    You married early, into a traditional Indian family, where you were supposed to have no opinions and now you're wondering where your life is heading.
    Know that you're a bright spark who will secure her own release. </p>
